# Project Requirements Document

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** LangChain Flow

LangChain Flow is a full-stack development tool designed to streamline and automate workflows for developers by integrating multiple code repositories, editors, and visualization tools. The application aims to provide a comprehensive solution for managing code, visualizing data flows, and integrating various services such as GitHub, Supabase, Vercel, and AI models like LangChain. The project serves as a powerful backend tool that facilitates both internal and external service integrations, helping developers to visualize processes, control integrations, and automate project workflows.

## Tech Stack and Tools

- **Core Technologies:**
  - Node.js (LTS)
  - Python (optional for alternative worker processes)
  - Next.js (for web applications)
  - Tailwind CSS (for fast UI development)
  - React (for frontend development)
  - Cytoscape.js or Mermaid (for graph visualization)

- **Development and Repository Tools:**
  - GitHub (repository management, pull requests, optional actions)
  - Cursor (primary editor/agent)
  - VS Code (fallback editor)
  - PNPM + Turborepo (for monorepo management and fast builds)

- **Backend and Data:**
  - Supabase (Postgres, optional Auth, Realtime features)
  - pgvector (embeddings in Postgres)
  - LangChain or LangGraph/LCEL (for language model integration)
  - InterTools (for log intake & click-to-chat functionality)
  - REST APIs and optional tRPC (for web-worker communication)

- **LLM and Costing:**
  - OpenAI or Anthropic (for large language models)
  - liteLLM (proxy + unified costing, optional)
  - Simple token/$ meter wrapper (for cost tracking)

- **Deployment and Observability:**
  - Vercel (for web deployment)
  - Supabase logs (for SQL + storage logging)
  - Pino (for Node.js logging)
  - Zod (for runtime validation)
  - PostHog (for product analytics) or Sentry (for error tracking)

- **Authentication:**
  - Auth.js or Clerk (optional, single-user mode for MVP)

- **Additional Tools:**
  - Google Analytics and Google Cloud Counsel API (for monitoring)
  - Vercel Readouts (for usage analytics with AI interpretation)

## Target Audience

The primary audience for LangChain Flow includes:

- **Developers and Engineers:** Looking for a streamlined and automated workflow to manage multiple projects and repositories.
- **Project Managers:** Interested in visualizing project flows and integrations.
- **Tech Enthusiasts:** Individuals interested in leveraging AI and visualization tools to enhance productivity.

The application aims to meet the needs of users who require a customizable and feature-rich development environment that integrates with modern cloud services and AI technologies.

   - Supports real-time developer LLM chat on web pages.

6. **Automation and Deployment:**
   - Automated workflows for project mapping and user edits.
   - Integration with Vercel for deployment and Supabase for data storage.

7. **AI and Service Integrations:**
   - LangChain for language model integration.
   - Supabase and SQL for internal storage and data flow management.

8. **Cost Monitoring:**
   - Tracks credits usage and consumption rate.
   - Provides insights into how fast credits are consumed.

## Authentication

- **Single-User Mode for MVP:** Initial version will support a single-user mode without complex authentication.
- **Optional Future Authentication:** Auth.js or Clerk can be integrated later for user sign-up, login, and account management.

## New User Flow

1. **Sign-Up/Login:** (Optional for future updates)
   - Users sign up or log in to access the application.
   
2. **Project Initialization:**
   - Users link their GitHub repository to the app.
   
3. **Editor Setup:**
   - Users choose between Cursor or VS Code for editing.
   
4. **Integration Visualization:**
   - Users visualize data flows and integrations in the app.
   
5. **Workflow Automation:**
   - Automated processes map out the project, and users can edit as needed.
   
6. **Monitoring and Insights:**
   - Users track usage, credits, and consumption rates.

## Constraints

- **Technical Limitations:**
  - Initial MVP will focus on core functionalities with limited support for advanced features.
  
- **Browser Support:**
  - Application should support modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
  
- **Performance Requirements:**
  - Focus on speed and efficiency to ensure smooth user experience.

## Known Issues

- **Integration Complexity:**
  - Initial integration with multiple services may require additional testing and adjustments.
  
- **Feature Limitations:**
