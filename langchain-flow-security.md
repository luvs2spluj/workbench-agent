# Security Guidelines Document for LangChain Flow

## Authentication & Authorization Rules

### OAuth Flows
- **Use OAuth 2.0**: Implement OAuth 2.0 for secure user authentication.
- **Redirect URIs**: Ensure all redirect URIs are registered and use HTTPS.
- **PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)**: Use PKCE for enhanced security in OAuth flows.

### JWT Handling
- **Signing Algorithms**: Use strong signing algorithms like RS256 for JWT tokens.
- **Expire Tokens**: Set short expiration times for tokens and implement refresh token flows.
- **Token Storage**: Store tokens securely, preferably in HTTP-only cookies.

### RBAC Implementation
- **Role Definitions**: Define roles and permissions clearly within the application.
- **Access Control**: Implement access controls based on user roles.
- **Least Privilege Principle**: Grant users the minimum permissions necessary for their role.

## Data Validation Rules

### Input Sanitization
- **Sanitize Inputs**: Use libraries to sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- **Whitelist Validation**: Prefer whitelist validation over blacklist validation.

### Type Checking
- **Strict Type Checking**: Enforce strict type checking using libraries like Zod.
- **Boundary Validation**: Validate data boundaries to prevent buffer overflow attacks.

## Environment Variables

### Secrets and Configuration
- **Environment Variables**: Store secrets such as API keys, database credentials, and tokens in environment variables.
- **Secure Storage**: Use services like Vercel Env/Secrets, Google Secret Manager, or Doppler for secure storage.

## Rate Limiting/Throttling

### Limits per Endpoint
- **Rate Limits**: Implement rate limits per endpoint to prevent abuse.
- **User-Based Limits**: Apply rate limits on a per-user basis to prevent any single user from overloading the system.

### DDoS Protection
- **Anti-DDoS Measures**: Use services like Cloudflare to protect against DDoS attacks.

## Error Handling & Logging

### Logging Practices
- **Sensitive Data**: Avoid logging sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers.
- **Structured Logging**: Use structured logging for better analysis and monitoring.

### Secure Error Messages
- **Generic Error Messages**: Display generic error messages to users to avoid revealing internal details.
- **Detailed Logs**: Keep detailed error logs internally for debugging purposes.

## Security Headers/Configs

### CORS Settings
- **Limited Origins**: Restrict CORS to specific origins that need access.
- **Preflight Caching**: Implement preflight request caching to improve performance.

### CSP Policies
- **Content Security Policy**: Define strict CSP policies to prevent XSS attacks.

### HTTPS Enforcement
- **SSL/TLS**: Ensure all data is transmitted over HTTPS to protect data in transit.

## Dependency Management

### Package Updates
- **Regular Updates**: Regularly update all packages and dependencies.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Use tools like npm audit or Snyk to scan for vulnerabilities.

## Data Protection

### Encryption
- **At Rest**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest using strong encryption algorithms.
- **In Transit**: Use TLS for encrypting data in transit.

### PII Handling
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only the necessary Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
- **Access Controls**: Implement strict access controls for PII data.
