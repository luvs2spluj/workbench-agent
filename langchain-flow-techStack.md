# Tech Stack Document for LangChain Flow Project

## Frontend Frameworks

### React
- **Version:** 18.2.0
- **Reason:** Provides a robust and flexible component model that simplifies the creation of interactive user interfaces.
- **Configuration:** 
  - Use with Create React App or Next.js for server-side rendering capabilities.
  - Integrate with React Query or SWR for efficient data fetching.

### TailwindCSS
- **Version:** 3.0
- **Reason:** Offers a utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development and design consistency.
- **Configuration:**
  - Include in the project setup using PostCSS.
  - Customize through a `tailwind.config.js` file for theme adjustments and plugin additions.

### Shadcn/ui
- **Purpose:** Provides basic UI components to accelerate front-end development.
- **Integration:** Easily integrates with TailwindCSS for consistent styling.

## Backend Frameworks

### Node.js
- **Version:** LTS
- **Reason:** Scalable and efficient for building web applications and backend services.
- **Setup:**
  - Use with Express.js for creating REST APIs.
  - Optionally integrate with tRPC for type-safe API communication between client and server.

### Python
- **Usage:** Optional alternative for worker processes.
- **Libraries:** Compatible with LangChain for language model integrations and tasks.

## Database

### Supabase
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Reason:** Provides a scalable, real-time database with built-in authentication.
- **Schema Considerations:**
  - Use `pgvector` for embeddings in Postgres.
  - Design schema to accommodate multiple integrations and user data.

## Authentication

### Auth.js
- **Reason:** Provides a simple solution for authentication needs.
- **Implementation:** Can be added later; MVP can initially remain single-user.

## DevOps/Hosting

### Vercel
- **Purpose:** Deployment platform for frontend applications.
- **CI/CD Setup:**
  - Use Vercel for automatic deployments with each commit.
  - Configure environment variables and secrets within Vercel's dashboard.

### Supabase Logs
- **Purpose:** SQL and storage logging for backend operations.
- **Integration:** Use Supabase logging for monitoring database activities and errors.

## APIs or SDKs

### OpenAI API
- **Purpose:** Language model integration for AI-driven features.
- **Integration:** Use for natural language processing tasks within the application.

### Google Cloud Logging
- **Purpose:** Cloud-native logging solution for enhanced observability.
- **Integration:** Track application performance and detect issues in real-time.

## Language Choices

### TypeScript
- **Reason:** Provides static typing and improved developer experience over JavaScript.
- **Usage:** Use across the codebase for type safety and better maintainability.

## Other Tools

### Development Tools
- **Cursor:** Primary code editor for development.
- **VS Code:** Secondary editor for fallback purposes.
- **PNPM + Turborepo:** Monorepo management and fast builds.

### Linters and Formatters
- **ESLint:** Ensures code quality and consistency.
- **Prettier:** Formats code for readability and maintainability.

### Testing Frameworks
- **Jest:** Main testing framework for unit and integration tests.
- **Cypress:** End-to-end testing framework for UI components.

This document outlines the tech stack choices for the LangChain Flow project, focusing on both the current MVP requirements and the potential for future scalability and feature enhancements. Each choice is driven by the need for performance, scalability, and a smooth developer experience.
